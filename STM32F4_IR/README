To run this example on a STM32F407 microcontroller:

1) connect a photo module (I used TSOP31236), wich decodes IR remote signals
to pin PB7. The photo module needs to be filtered with
a 4.7uF capacitor (check datasheet) and connected to VCC through
a 100ohm resistor.

TSOP31236 uses a supply voltage of 5V, however PB7 is 5V tolerant,
so this isn't a problem.

2) connect PA2 (UART TX pin) to a UART-USB converter and open a 
serial port terminal (for example, GTK Term).
